# Magic 8 Ball ðŸ”®

### Project Description
This project is a playful, interactive Magic 8 Ball simulator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users type in yes/no questions and click a button to receive randomized answers displayed within a stylized animated "8 ball". The ball features smooth fade animations, floating motion, and sound effects for an engaging experience. The design is responsive and visually appealing, with glowing effects and transitions to simulate a real magic 8 ball experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep asking serious questions to unreliable friends or search engines. What if instead, they could get answers from a perfectly unpredictable floating oracle?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Enter the Magic 8 Ball: a virtual, animated, yes-or-no answer generator. Ask your question, click the button, and receive cosmic guidance through a mesmerizing 8-ball interfaceâ€”complete with floating animations, audio, and dramatic answer reveals.
